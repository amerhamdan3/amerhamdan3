## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a passion for building scalable, fast, and modern web applications. I love turning ideas into functional, high-performance digital experiences that people actually enjoy using! 🎯

My tech stack is pretty diverse – I work extensively with **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, **PHP**, and **Next.js**. My work usually combines backend logic with frontend precision, creating products that are both efficient and delightful to use. ✨

I'm an **expert in PHP and Laravel** 💜, having created and managed many large-scale projects over the years. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that balance performance, security, and flexibility. Laravel remains one of my strongest frameworks – I've used it to power everything from advanced APIs to complete business platforms with admin dashboards and content systems.

I've also had the chance to experiment with **AI-driven systems** 🤖, adding intelligent features to improve automation and user interaction. The intersection of traditional development and AI is fascinating!

> 🐱 When I'm not coding, I'm usually spending time with my cat – who has very specific requirements about her water (it must be cold and from the faucet, obviously). She's also my unofficial code reviewer, though her feedback is mostly "meow" and occasional keyboard walks. 😸
